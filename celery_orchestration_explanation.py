# Celery Task Orchestration in ArkFoundry's ArcFlow Engine
# ==================================================================================

## 1. Introduction to Celery and its Role in ArkFoundry

Celery is a powerful, open-source asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed
message passing. It allows applications to offload time-consuming or resource-intensive
operations to separate worker processes, improving responsiveness and scalability.

In the ArkFoundry platform, Celery is the cornerstone of the **ArcFlow Engine (MVP 1)**.
It enables the engine to:
    - Execute individual tasks within a complex workflow asynchronously.
    - Handle potentially long-running operations (like AI model inference or large data processing)
      without blocking the main application or API responses.
    - Distribute task execution across multiple worker processes, which can be scaled
      independently on different machines.
    - Implement robust features like automatic retries for failed tasks.

The core idea is that when an ArcFlow workflow is executed, its constituent tasks are
not run directly by the API service. Instead, they are sent as messages to a **task queue**
(managed by a message broker like RabbitMQ or Redis). Dedicated **Celery worker processes**
monitor this queue, pick up tasks, execute them, and (if needed) enqueue subsequent tasks.

## 2. Real Celery Orchestration in ArcFlow Engine (Production Scenario)

In a production environment, the ArcFlow Engine interacts with Celery as follows:

### 2.1. Triggering a Workflow and Enqueuing Initial Tasks

When a user or system triggers a workflow execution (e.g., via an API call to
`POST /api/v1/arcflow/workflows/{workflow_id}/execute`), the `ArcFlowService`
handles this:

```python
# Snippet from platform/services/arcflow_service.py (ArcFlowService.trigger_execution)

# ... (workflow definition loaded, execution record created) ...
# execution = WorkflowExecution(...)
# db.session.add(execution)
# db.session.commit() # Commit to get execution.id

# ... (determine initial tasks after 'start' node) ...
# for node_id in initial_task_node_ids:
#     task_def = ...
#     if task_def:
#         task_exec = TaskExecution(
#             workflow_execution_id=execution.id,
#             node_id_in_workflow=node_id,
#             # ... other fields ...
#             status='SCHEDULED'
#         )
#         db.session.add(task_exec)
#         db.session.commit() # Get task_exec.id

#         # Enqueue Celery task using .delay() (shortcut for .apply_async())
#         _execute_task_async.delay(
#             task_execution_id=str(task_exec.id),
#             workflow_definition_id=str(workflow_def.id),
#             workflow_execution_id=str(execution.id)
#         )
# execution.status = 'RUNNING'
# db.session.commit()
```

**Explanation**:
-   `ArcFlowService.trigger_execution` identifies the first set of tasks to run after the 'start' node.
-   For each initial task, a `TaskExecution` record is created in the database with status 'SCHEDULED'.
-   Crucially, `_execute_task_async.delay(...)` is called. `_execute_task_async` is a Celery task function (defined below). The `.delay()` method is a shortcut to send a message to the Celery task queue, instructing a worker to execute `_execute_task_async` with the provided arguments.
-   The API call returns quickly (e.g., HTTP 202 Accepted) after enqueuing the initial tasks, not waiting for the entire workflow to finish.

### 2.2. The Celery Task: `_execute_task_async`

This is the heart of the distributed workflow execution. It's a Python function decorated
to be a Celery task.

```python
# Snippet from platform/services/arcflow_service.py

# from app import celery_app # Celery app instance

# @celery_app.task(bind=True, name='arcflow.execute_task', max_retries=3, default_retry_delay=60)
# def _execute_task_async(self, task_execution_id: str, workflow_definition_id: str, workflow_execution_id: str):
#     # `self` is the Celery task instance, providing context like request.id, retries, etc.
#     # from platform.app import db as celery_db # Import db within task for correct context
    
#     logger.info(f"Celery task started for TaskExecution ID: {task_execution_id}")
#     task_exec = celery_db.session.get(TaskExecution, task_execution_id)
#     # ... (fetch workflow_def, workflow_exec, node_definition) ...

#     task_exec.status = 'RUNNING'
#     task_exec.started_at = datetime.utcnow()
#     # ... (log start) ...
#     celery_db.session.commit()

#     task_output = None
#     task_failed = False
#     error_message = None

#     try:
#         node_type = node_definition.get('type')
#         # === CORE TASK LOGIC BASED ON NODE TYPE ===
#         if node_type == 'task':
#             # task_output = _execute_task_logic_placeholder(node_definition.get('config'), task_exec.input_data)
#             pass # Placeholder for actual generic task execution
#         elif node_type == 'ai_model_inference':
#             # model_id = node_config.get('model_id')
#             # prediction_result = AIModelEngine().predict(model_id, ..., task_exec.input_data)
#             # task_output = prediction_result
#             pass # Placeholder for AI model call
#         elif node_type == 'conditional_branch':
#             # ... (evaluate condition based on task_exec.input_data) ...
#             # task_output = {"condition_met": True/False, "branch_taken": "true_path"/"false_path"}
#             pass
#         # ... (other node types: parallel_gateway, join_gateway etc.) ...
        
#         task_exec.status = 'COMPLETED'
#         task_exec.output_data = task_output
#         # ... (log completion) ...

#     except Exception as e:
#         # ... (handle failure, set status to FAILED, log error) ...
#         # Implement retry logic using self.retry(exc=e, countdown=...) if applicable based on node_config
#         pass
    
#     task_exec.ended_at = datetime.utcnow()
#     celery_db.session.commit()

#     if not task_failed:
#         # === DETERMINE AND ENQUEUE NEXT TASKS ===
#         # next_node_ids = ... (logic to find next nodes in DAG based on current node and output) ...
#         # for next_node_id in next_node_ids:
#             # ... (create next_task_exec record with status 'SCHEDULED') ...
#             # _execute_task_async.delay(
#             #     task_execution_id=str(next_task_exec.id),
#             #     # ... other args ...
#             # )
#         pass
    
#     # Final check for workflow completion
#     # _check_and_finalize_workflow(workflow_exec, celery_db)
#     return {"status": "SUCCESS" or "ERROR", "output": task_output}
```

**Explanation**:
-   The `@celery_app.task(...)` decorator registers this function with Celery.
    -   `bind=True`: Makes `self` (the task instance) the first argument.
    -   `name`: Explicit name for the task in the Celery system.
    -   `max_retries`, `default_retry_delay`: Configure automatic retries on failure.
-   **Execution Logic**:
    1.  Fetches its `TaskExecution` record and related workflow data from the database.
    2.  Updates its status to 'RUNNING'.
    3.  Performs the actual work defined by the `node_type` (e.g., call an AI model, run a script, evaluate a condition). This is the "business logic" of the workflow node.
    4.  Updates its status to 'COMPLETED' or 'FAILED' and stores its output.
    5.  **Crucially**: If successful, it inspects the workflow DAG to find the next node(s). For each next node, it creates a new `TaskExecution` record and then calls `_execute_task_async.delay(...)` again, effectively chaining the workflow execution.
-   **Database Interaction**: Each Celery task operates within its own database session (or uses the main app's session carefully if configured for that, though separate sessions per task are safer for long-running tasks).

### 2.3. Message Broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis)

-   Celery requires a message broker to handle the queue of tasks.
-   When `.delay()` is called, a message describing the task and its arguments is sent to the broker.
-   ArkFoundry's `docker-compose.yml` and Terraform scripts would configure and deploy a message broker service.

### 2.4. Celery Workers

-   In production, one or more Celery worker processes are run independently of the Flask API application.
-   Command to start workers: `celery -A platform.app.celery_app worker -l info -Q arcflow_tasks` (example queue name).
-   These workers connect to the message broker, pull tasks from the queue, and execute the `_execute_task_async` function.
-   They can be scaled horizontally by running more worker instances, potentially on different machines.

## 3. Celery Simulation in E2E (and some Unit/Integration) Tests

Running a full Celery setup (workers, broker) for automated tests can be complex, slow, and introduce flakiness. Therefore, ArkFoundry tests simulate Celery's behavior.

### 3.1. `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = True`

-   This is a key Celery configuration setting used during testing.
-   When `True`, calls to `task.delay()` or `task.apply_async()` do **not** send a message to the broker. Instead, the task function (`_execute_task_async` in our case) is executed **synchronously** in the same process that called `.delay()`.
-   **Effect**: The task runs immediately as if it were a direct function call. Asynchronous behavior is lost, but the task's logic is executed.
-   **Setup**: This is typically set in the Flask app configuration for the 'testing' environment:
    ```python
    # In platform/config.py or test setup
    # class TestingConfig(Config):
    #     TESTING = True
    #     SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('TEST_DATABASE_URL') or 'sqlite:///:memory:'
    #     CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = True
    #     CELERY_TASK_EAGER_PROPAGATES = True # Exceptions from eager tasks are re-raised
    ```

### 3.2. `simulate_celery_tasks_from_execution` Helper (for E2E Tests)

While `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER` makes individual task calls synchronous, testing an entire *multi-step workflow* requires simulating the chain reaction of tasks enqueuing subsequent tasks. The `_execute_task_async` function, when run eagerly, will still try to call `.delay()` for the next tasks. Since these subsequent `.delay()` calls also become synchronous, a recursive-like execution happens.

The `simulate_celery_tasks_from_execution` helper function (used in `tests/test_arcflow_service.py` for E2E scenarios) formalizes this by:

```python
# Simplified concept from tests/test_arcflow_service.py

# def simulate_celery_tasks_from_execution(execution_id: str, workflow_def_id: str, app_context):
#     processed_task_ids = set()
#     max_iterations = 20 # Safety break
#     iterations = 0
#     while iterations < max_iterations:
#         iterations += 1
#         # Fetch tasks that are 'SCHEDULED' for this execution from DB
#         tasks_to_run = TaskExecution.query.filter_by(
#             workflow_execution_id=execution_id, status='SCHEDULED'
#         ).all()
#         if not tasks_to_run: break

#         for task_exec_record in tasks_to_run:
#             if str(task_exec_record.id) in processed_task_ids: continue
#             processed_task_ids.add(str(task_exec_record.id))
            
#             # Directly call the Celery task function (which will run synchronously due to EAGER setting)
#             # This simulates a worker picking up and executing the task.
#             with app_context: # Ensure Flask app context for DB access etc.
#                 _execute_task_async(
#                     task_execution_id=str(task_exec_record.id),
#                     workflow_definition_id=workflow_def_id,
#                     workflow_execution_id=execution_id
#                 )
#     # ... (logging for max iterations)
```

**Explanation**:
1.  After `ArcFlowService.trigger_execution` is called in a test (which schedules the *first* set of tasks), this helper is invoked.
2.  It repeatedly queries the database for `TaskExecution` records in the 'SCHEDULED' state for the current workflow execution.
3.  For each 'SCHEDULED' task it finds, it directly calls `_execute_task_async(...)`.
    *   Because `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER` is true, this call runs the task logic immediately.
    *   If that task logic successfully completes and enqueues *new* tasks (by calling `.delay()` on `_execute_task_async`), those new tasks will also run synchronously if `CELERY_TASK_EAGER_PROPAGATES` is also true and the call stack allows. However, the helper loop ensures that any tasks that were merely *scheduled* (i.e., their DB record set to 'SCHEDULED' and `.delay()` was called) are picked up in the next iteration of the `while` loop.
4.  This process continues until no more tasks are left in the 'SCHEDULED' state, simulating the entire workflow processing to completion or failure within the test function.

### 3.3. Mocking `.delay()` with `@patch` (for specific Unit/Integration Tests)

In some tests, particularly unit tests for the `ArcFlowService.trigger_execution` method itself, we might not want `_execute_task_async` to run at all. We only want to verify that it *would have been called* (i.e., a task was correctly enqueued).

```python
# Example from a hypothetical unit test for trigger_execution
# from unittest.mock import patch

# @patch('platform.services.arcflow_service._execute_task_async.delay')
# def test_trigger_execution_enqueues_initial_tasks(mock_celery_delay, db_session, test_user):
#     # ... (setup workflow definition) ...
#     ArcFlowService.trigger_execution(workflow_id, str(test_user.id), {})
    
#     # Assert that .delay() was called for the expected initial tasks
#     mock_celery_delay.assert_called_once_with(
#         task_execution_id=ANY, # or specific ID if predictable
#         workflow_definition_id=ANY,
#         workflow_execution_id=ANY
#     )
```
This approach isolates the `trigger_execution` logic from the actual task execution logic.

## 4. Conclusion

-   **Production**: ArkFoundry ArcFlow relies on a full Celery setup with a message broker and dedicated worker processes for true asynchronous, distributed, and scalable workflow execution. The `_execute_task_async` function is the core distributed task, chaining itself by enqueuing subsequent tasks.
-   **Testing**: To ensure fast, reliable, and isolated tests without external dependencies:
    -   `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = True` makes individual Celery task calls synchronous.
    -   Helper functions like `simulate_celery_tasks_from_execution` manage the *sequence* of these synchronous calls to test the overall orchestration logic within the service layer.
    -   Direct mocking of `.delay()` is used for unit tests focusing on the enqueueing mechanism itself.

This dual approach allows the same core service logic within `_execute_task_async` to be rigorously tested in a simulated synchronous environment, while being designed to run effectively in a distributed asynchronous production environment.
