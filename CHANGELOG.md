- **Consent Management**:
    - `ConsentRecord` model and service for recording user consent for data processing activities.
    - Logic to check for active and valid consent.
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable audit logs for all data asset lifecycle events, classification changes, encryption operations, and consent actions.

#### üëÅÔ∏è MVP 4: Threat Intelligence Engine (Classical AI)
- **Threat Feed Ingestion**:
    - Connectors for STIX/TAXII 2.1, RSS, and generic API OSINT feeds (configurable via `ThreatFeed` model).
    - Scheduled, asynchronous fetching and parsing of intelligence via Celery.
    - Normalization and deduplication of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs: IPs, domains, hashes, URLs, emails, CVEs).
- **IOC Enrichment**:
    - Automated enrichment via GeoIP, WHOIS, and VirusTotal (Public API).
    - Enriched data stored in `Indicator.enrichment_data`.
- **Correlation & Analysis (Classical AI)**:

- **Secure Document Ingestion**: UI for government employees to upload documents. Mock virus scan.
- **AI-Assisted Classification & Confirmation**: Uploaded documents (as `DataAsset`s) are classified using `DataSovereigntyService` (AI suggestion). A "SecurityOfficer" role can confirm/override this classification via a dedicated UI queue.
- **Orchestrated Processing**: A specific ArcFlow `WorkflowDefinition` ("Secure Government Document Processing") is triggered for uploaded documents. This workflow includes (mocked for Phase 1) steps like OCR, PII redaction, and summarization.
- **Zero Trust Access Control**: ZTA policies implemented to control access (view metadata, download content) to processed government documents based on the user's `security_clearance_level` and the document's `DataAsset.classification_label`.
- **UI for Document Access**: Searchable list and detail view for processed documents, with access strictly controlled by ZTA.
- **Full Audit Trail**: All document lifecycle events (upload, classification, processing steps, access attempts) are logged in `DataSovereigntyAudit` and `ZTAAuditLog`.

### Improved
