## 2. Release 1.7 Highlights

This release delivers a fully functional, classical AI-powered platform with seven interconnected MVPs, validated through comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) testing:

1.  **üß† ArcFlow Engine (Classical Orchestration)**:
    *   Enterprise-grade workflow automation with DAG-based definitions.
    *   Asynchronous, scalable task execution via Celery, supporting complex logic (sequential, parallel, conditional).
    *   Robust state management, AI model integration points, and comprehensive API.

2.  **üõ°Ô∏è Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) Engine**:
    *   NIST SP 800-207 aligned dynamic access control.
    *   Evaluates user identity, device trust, resource sensitivity, and AI-driven behavioral risk.
    *   Granular policy management and full auditability of access decisions.

3.  **üîí Data Sovereignty Module**:
    *   AI-assisted data classification and sensitivity scoring.
    *   Crypto-agile encryption framework for data at rest (mock KMS for v1.7) and TLS for data in transit.
    *   Foundational support for data residency policies and GDPR-aligned consent management.

4.  **üëÅÔ∏è Threat Intelligence Engine (Classical AI)**:
    *   Automated ingestion and normalization of IOCs from STIX/TAXII and OSINT feeds.
    *   IOC enrichment (GeoIP, WHOIS, VirusTotal) and NLP-based IOC extraction from reports.
    *   Rule-based correlation, threat scoring, and alerting on critical threats.

5.  **‚öôÔ∏è Admin Platform**:
    *   Centralized web interface for comprehensive management of all platform entities across the 7 MVPs.
    *   Full CRUD capabilities, user/role/permission management, and system settings configuration.
    *   Unified audit log viewer for platform-wide visibility.

6.  **üß© Developer Portal**:
    *   Self-service portal for developer registration, API application management, and secure API key lifecycle (generation, viewing, revocation).
    *   Live, auto-generated OpenAPI 3.0 documentation for all public APIs.

7.  **üèõÔ∏è Government Solutions (Secure Document Processing Workflow)**:
    *   End-to-end secure document lifecycle: ingestion, AI-assisted classification (e.g., KSA-OFFICIAL, KSA-SECRET), officer confirmation, ArcFlow-orchestrated processing (mocked steps), and ZTA-controlled access based on user security clearance levels.

**Key Achievement**: All implemented features have passed a rigorous, automated End-to-End testing suite, validating functionality, integration, security, and data integrity across the platform.
